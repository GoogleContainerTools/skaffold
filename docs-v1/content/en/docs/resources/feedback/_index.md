Your feedback is very important to us, and a critical part of making Skaffold the best it can be!
There are a few easy ways to make your voice heard.

## Quick Survey
Take our [quick 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/BMTbGQXLWSdn7vEs6) to tell us how satisfied you are with
Skaffold, and what improvements you think we should make.

## Skaffold Feedback Session
The Skaffold team actively incorporates user feedback into the product as it evolves.
We're always looking to have conversations with developers like you to learn about
the different ways you use Skaffold, and what improvements you think we can make to
better suit your workflow.

**What is a feedback session?**

We periodically schedule hour long video conference sessions with both individual developers and teams
to get more personalized feedback. If you're interested in talking with us, fill out our
[feedback form](https://forms.gle/J5h567ncypY2ziq49), and we'll schedule a session at a time
convenient for you. No preparation is needed!
