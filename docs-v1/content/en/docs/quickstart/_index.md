Follow this tutorial if you're using the Skaffold [standalone binary]({{< relref "../install/#standalone-binary" >}}). It walks through running Skaffold on a small Kubernetes app built with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) inside [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)
and deployed with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)! 

This tutorial uses minikube as Skaffold knows how to build the app using the Docker daemon hosted
inside minikube and thus avoiding any need for a registry to host the app's container images.


{{< alert title="Note">}}
Aside from `Docker` and `kubectl`, Skaffold also supports a variety of other tools
and workflows; see [Tutorials]({{<relref "/docs/tutorials">}}) for
more information.
{{</alert>}}


In this quickstart, you will:

* Install Skaffold, and download a sample go app,
* Use `skaffold dev` to build and deploy your app every time your code changes,
* Use `skaffold run` to build and deploy your app once, similar to a CI/CD pipeline

## Set up

This tutorial requires Skaffold, Minikube, and Kubectl.

* [Install Skaffold]({{< relref "/docs/install" >}})
* [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [Install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

### Start Minikube

```
minikube start --profile custom
skaffold config set --global local-cluster true
eval $(minikube -p custom docker-env)
```

{{< alert title="Note">}}
If you want to deploy against a different Kubernetes cluster then you will have to install Docker to build this app.
Furthermore if you want to deploy to a remote cluster, such as GKE, then you need to set up a container
registry such as [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) to host the resulting images.
{{</alert>}}

### Downloading the sample app

1. Clone the Skaffold repository:

    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold
    ```

1. Change to the `examples/getting-started` in skaffold directory.

    ```bash
    cd skaffold/examples/getting-started
    ```

## `skaffold dev`: continuous build & deploy on code changes

Run `skaffold dev` to build and deploy your app continuously.
You should see some outputs similar to the following entries:

```

```

{{< alert title="Error: Unknown API Version" >}}
Skaffold may complain:
```
parsing skaffold config: unknown api version: "skaffold/v2beta13"
```

This error indicates that you are not using the latest release of
Skaffold.  Cloud Shell may lag for several days after a new Skaffold release.
Simply [install the latest version of Skaffold]({{< relref "/docs/install" >}}).
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Error: No push access to specified image repository">}}
If you are deploying to a remote cluster, you must run `skaffold dev --default-repo=<my_registry>`
where `<my_registry>` is an image registry that you have write-access to. Skaffold then
builds and pushes the container images to that location, and non-destructively
updates the Kubernetes manifest files to reference those pushed images.
{{< /alert >}}

`skaffold dev` watches your local source code and executes your Skaffold pipeline
every time a change is detected. `skaffold.yaml` provides specifications of the
workflow - in this example, the pipeline is

* Building a Docker image from the source using the Dockerfile
* Tagging the Docker image with the `sha256` hash of its contents
* Updating the Kubernetes manifest, `k8s-pod.yaml`, to use the image built previously
* Deploying the Kubernetes manifest using `kubectl apply -f`
* Streaming the logs back from the deployed app

Let's re-trigger the workflow just by a single code change!
Update `main.go` as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	for {
		fmt.Println("Hello Skaffold!")
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	}
}
```

When you save the file, Skaffold will see this change and repeat the workflow described in
`skaffold.yaml`, rebuilding and redeploying your application. Once the pipeline
is completed, you should see the changes reflected in the output in the terminal:

```
[getting-started] Hello Skaffold!
```

<span style="font-size: 36pt">âœ¨</span>

## `skaffold run`: build & deploy once 

If you prefer building and deploying once at a time, run `skaffold run`.
Skaffold will perform the workflow described in `skaffold.yaml` exactly once.
