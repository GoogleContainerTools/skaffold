This basic example creates a box titled "Hello, World!" and displays it in your terminal:

package main

import (
	"github.com/rivo/tview"
)

func main() {
	box := tview.NewBox().SetBorder(true).SetTitle("Hello, world!")
	if err := tview.NewApplication().SetRoot(box, true).Run(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

## Versioning and Backwards-Compatibility

I try really hard to keep this project backwards compatible. Your software should not break when you upgrade `tview`. But this also means that some of its shortcomings that were present in the initial versions will remain. In addition, at least for the time being, you won't find any version tags in this repo. The newest version should be the one to upgrade to. It has all the bugfixes and latest features. Having said that, backwards compatibility may still break when:

- a new version of an imported package (most likely [`tcell`](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell)) changes in such a way that forces me to make changes in `tview` as well,
- I fix something that I consider a bug, rather than a feature, something that does not work as originally intended,
- I make changes to "internal" interfaces such as [`Primitive`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rivo/tview#Primitive). You shouldn't need these interfaces unless you're writing your own primitives for `tview`. (Yes, I realize these are public interfaces. This has advantages as well as disadvantages. For the time being, it is what it is.)
