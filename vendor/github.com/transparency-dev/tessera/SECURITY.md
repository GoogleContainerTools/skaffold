# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera/security/advisories) tab.

We ask you to submit high-quality reports, including as many details as possible, a buildable proof of concept against a recent build, a crash dump if available, and instructions on reproducing the issue. Please also include information about the affected software version, a description of the issueâ€™s impact, and an attack scenario, as that helps us assess the vulnerability quickly and effectively.
