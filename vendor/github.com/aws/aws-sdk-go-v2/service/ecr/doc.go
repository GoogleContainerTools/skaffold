// EC2 Container Registry.
//
// Amazon Elastic Container Registry Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon
// ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the
// familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage
// images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your
// Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private
// repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or
// Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images. Amazon ECR has service
// endpoints in each supported Region. For more information, see Amazon ECR
// endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html) in the Amazon
// Web Services General Reference.
