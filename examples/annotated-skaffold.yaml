build:
  # tagPolicy determines how skaffold is going to tag your images.
  # We provide a few strategies here, although you most likely won't need to care!
  # The policy can `gitCommit`, `sha256` or `envTemplate`.
  # If not specified, it defaults to `gitCommit: {}`.
  tagPolicy:
    # Tag the image with the git commit of your current repository.
    gitCommit: {}

    # Tag the image with the checksum of the built image (image id).
    sha256: {}

    # Tag the image with a configurable template string.
    # The template must be in the golang text/template syntax: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
    # The template is compiled and executed against the current environment,
    # with those variables injected:
    #   IMAGE_NAME   |  Name of the image being built, as supplied in the artifacts section.
    #   DIGEST       |  Digest of the newly built image. For eg. `sha256:27ffc7f352665cc50ae3cbcc4b2725e36062f1b38c611b6f95d6df9a7510de23`.
    #   DIGEST_ALGO  |  Algorithm used by the digest: For eg. `sha256`.
    #   DIGEST_HEX   |  Digest of the newly built image. For eg. `27ffc7f352665cc50ae3cbcc4b2725e36062f1b38c611b6f95d6df9a7510de23`.
    # Example
    # envTemplate:
    #  template: "{{.RELEASE}}-{{.IMAGE_NAME}}"

    # Tag the image with the build timestamp.
    #  The format can be overridden with golang formats, see: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format
    #    Default format is "2006-01-02_15-04-05.999_MST
    #  The timezone is by default the local timezone, this can be overridden, see https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.LoadLocation
    # dateTime:
    #   format: "2006-01-02"
    #   timezone: "UTC"

  # artifacts is a list of the actual images you're going to be building
  # you can include as many as you want here.
  artifacts:
    # The name of the image to be built.
  - imageName: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold-example
    # The path to your dockerfile context. Defaults to ".".
    workspace: ../examples/getting-started

    # Each artifact is of a given type among: `docker` and `bazel`.
    # If not specified, it defaults to `docker: {}`.
    docker:
      # Dockerfile's location relative to workspace. Defaults to "Dockerfile"
      dockerfilePath: Dockerfile
      # Key/value arguements passed to the docker build.
      buildArgs:
        key1: "value1"
        key2: "value2"
      # Images to consider as cache sources
      cacheFrom:
      - image1
      - image2

    # bazel requires bazel CLI to be installed and the artifacts sources to
    # contain Bazel configuration files.
    # bazel:
    #  target: //:skaffold_example.tar

# This next section is where you'll put your specific builder configuration.
  # Valid builders are `local`, `googleCloudBuild` and `kaniko.
  # Defaults to `local: {}`
  # Example
  # local:
    # Pushing the images can be skipped. If no value is specified, it'll default to
    # `true` on minikube or Docker for Desktop, for even faster build and deploy cycles.
    # `false` on other types of kubernetes clusters that require pushing the images.
    # Skaffold defers to your ~/.docker/config for authentication information.
    # If you're using Google Container Registry, make sure that you have gcloud and
    # docker-credentials-helper-gcr configured correctly.
    # skipPush: true

  # Docker artifacts can be built on Google Container Builder. The projectId then needs
  # to be provided and the currently logged user should be given permissions to trigger
  # new builds on GCB.
  #  googleCloudBuild:
  #   projectId: YOUR_PROJECT

  # Docker artifacts can be built on a Kubernetes cluster with Kaniko.
  # Sources will be sent to a GCS bucket whose name is provided.
  # Kaniko also needs access to a service account to push the final image.
  # See https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#running-kaniko-in-a-kubernetes-cluster
  # Example
  # kaniko:
  #   gcsBucket: k8s-skaffold
  #   pullSecret: /a/secret/path/serviceaccount.json
  #   namespace: default

# The deploy section has all the information needed to deploy. Along with build:
# it is a required section.
deploy:
  # The type of the deployment method can be `kubectl` or `helm`.

  # The kubectl deployer uses  a client side `kubectl apply` to apply the manifests to the cluster.
  # You'll need a kubectl CLI version installed that's compatible with your cluster.
  kubectl:
    # manifests to deploy from files.
    manifests:
    - ../examples/getting-started/k8s-*

    # manifests to deploy from remote cluster.
    # The path to where these manifests live in remote kubernetes cluster.
    # Example
    # remoteManifests:
    # - deployment/web-app1
    # - namespace:deployment/web-app2

 # helm:
    # helm releases to deploy.
    # releases:
    # - name: skaffold-helm
    #   chartPath: skaffold-helm
    #   valuesFilePath: helm-skaffold-values.yaml
    #   values:
    #     image: skaffold-helm
    #   namespace: skaffold
    #   version: ""
    #
    #   # setValues get appended to the helm deploy with --set.
    #   setValues:
    #    key: "value"
    #
    #   # packaged section allows to package chart setting specific version
    #   # and/or appVersion using "helm package" command.
    #   packaged:
    #     # version is passed to "helm package --version" flag.
    #     # Note that you can specify both static string or dynamic template.
    #     version: {{ .CHART_VERSION }}-dirty
    #     # appVersion is passed to "helm package --app-version" flag.
    #     # Note that you can specify both static string or dynamic template.
    #     appVersion: {{ .CHART_VERSION }}-dirty

# profiles section has all the profile information which can be used to override any build or deploy configuration
profiles:
  - name: gcb
    build:
      googleCloudBuild:
        projectId: k8s-skaffold
