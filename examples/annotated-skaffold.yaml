# The build section has all the information needed to build images.
# It is a required section.
build:
  # tagPolicy (beta) determines how Skaffold is going to tag your images.
  # We provide a few strategies here, although you most likely won't need to care!
  # The policy can `gitCommit` (beta), `sha256` (beta), `envTemplate` (beta) or `dateTime` (beta).
  # If not specified, it defaults to `gitCommit: {}`.
  tagPolicy:
    # gitCommit tags the image with the git commit of your current repository.
    gitCommit: {}

    # sha256 tags the image with the checksum of the built image (image id).
    # sha256: {}

    # envTemplate tags the image with a configurable template string.
    # The template must be in the golang text/template syntax: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
    # The template is compiled and executed against the current environment,
    # with those variables injected:
    #   IMAGE_NAME   |  Name of the image being built, as supplied in the artifacts section.
    #   DIGEST       |  Digest of the newly built image. For eg. `sha256:27ffc7f352665cc50ae3cbcc4b2725e36062f1b38c611b6f95d6df9a7510de23`.
    #   DIGEST_ALGO  |  Algorithm used by the digest: For eg. `sha256`.
    #   DIGEST_HEX   |  Digest of the newly built image. For eg. `27ffc7f352665cc50ae3cbcc4b2725e36062f1b38c611b6f95d6df9a7510de23`.
    # Example
    # envTemplate:
    #  template: "{{.RELEASE}}-{{.IMAGE_NAME}}"

    # dateTime tags the image with the build timestamp.
    #  The format can be overridden with golang formats, see: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format
    #    Default format is "2006-01-02_15-04-05.999_MST
    #  The timezone is by default the local timezone, this can be overridden, see https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.LoadLocation
    # dateTime:
    #   format: "2006-01-02"
    #   timezone: "UTC"

  # artifacts is a list of the actual images you're going to be building
  # you can include as many as you want here.
  artifacts:
    # The name of the image to be built.
  - image: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold-example
    # The path to your dockerfile context. Defaults to ".".
    context: ../examples/getting-started
    # Skaffold can sync local files with remote pods (alpha) instead
    # of rebuilding the whole artifact's image. This is a mapping
    # of local files to sync to remote folders.
    # sync:
    #   '*.py': .

    # Each artifact is of a given type among: `docker` (beta), `bazel` (beta), `jibMaven` (alpha) and `jibGradle` (alpha).
    # If not specified, it defaults to `docker: {}`.
    docker:
      # Dockerfile's location relative to workspace. Defaults to "Dockerfile"
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      # Key/value arguements passed to the docker build.
      buildArgs:
        key1: "value1"
        key2: "value2"
      # Images to consider as cache sources
      cacheFrom:
      - golang:1.10.1-alpine3.7
      - alpine:3.7
      # Dockerfile target name to build.
      # target: stageName

    # bazel requires bazel CLI to be installed and the artifacts sources to
    # contain Bazel configuration files.
    # bazel:
    #   target: //:skaffold_example.tar
    #   additional args to pass to `bazel build`
    #   args:
    #   - "arg1"

    # jibMaven builds containers using the Jib plugin for Maven.
    # jibMaven:
    #  module: modulename     # selects which maven module to build, for a multimodule project
    #  profile: profilename   # selects which maven profile to activate

    # jibGradle builds containers using the Jib plugin for Gradle.
    # jibGradle:
    #  project: projectname   # selects which gradle project to build

# This next section is where you'll put your specific builder configuration.
  # Valid builders are `local` (beta), `googleCloudBuild` (beta) and `kaniko` (beta).
  # Defaults to `local: {}`

  # Pushing the images can be skipped. If no value is specified, it'll default to
  # `true` on minikube or Docker for Desktop, for even faster build and deploy cycles.
  # `false` on other types of kubernetes clusters that require pushing the images.
  # skaffold defers to your ~/.docker/config for authentication information.
  # If you're using Google Container Registry, make sure that you have gcloud and
  # docker-credentials-helper-gcr configured correctly.
  #
  # By default, the local builder connects to the Docker daemon with Go code to build
  # images. If `useDockerCLI` is set, skaffold will simply shell out to the docker CLI.
  # `useBuildkit` can also be set to activate the experimental BuildKit feature.
  #
  # local:
  #   false by default for local clusters, true for remote clusters
  #   push: false
  #   useDockerCLI: false
  #   useBuildkit: false

  # Docker and Jib artifacts can be built on Google Cloud Build. The projectId then needs
  # to be provided and the currently logged user should be given permissions to trigger
  # new builds on Cloud Build.
  # If the projectId is not provided, Skaffold will try to guess it from the image name.
  # For eg. If the artifact image name is gcr.io/myproject/image, then Skaffold will use
  # the `myproject` GCP project.
  # All the other parameters are also optional. The default values are listed here:
  #  googleCloudBuild:
  #   projectId: YOUR_PROJECT
  #   diskSizeGb: 200
  #   machineType: "N1_HIGHCPU_8"|"N1_HIGHCPU_32"
  #   timeout: 10000s
  #   dockerImage: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
  #   mavenImage: gcr.io/cloud-builders/mvn
  #   gradleImage: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gradle

  # Docker artifacts can be built on a Kubernetes cluster with Kaniko.
  # Exactly one buildContext must be specified to use kaniko
  # If localDir is specified, skaffold will mount sources directly via a emptyDir volume	
  # If gcsBucket is specified, skaffold will send sources to the GCS bucket provided
  # Kaniko also needs access to a service account to push the final image.
  # See https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#running-kaniko-in-a-kubernetes-cluster
  # If cache is specified, kaniko will use a remote cache which will speed up builds.
  # A cache repo can be specified to store cached layers, otherwise one will be inferred
  # from the image name. See https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#caching 
  #
  # Additional flags can be specified as a list. To see all additional flags, visit:
