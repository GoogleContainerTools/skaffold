# Development

This doc explains the development workflow so you can get started
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to Skaffold!


## Requirements

You must install these tools:

1. [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install): The language skaffold is
   built in (version >= go 1.14)
1. [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): For source control
1. [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): For building skaffold.

## Getting started

First you will need to setup your GitHub account and create a fork:

1. Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
1. Setup [GitHub access via
   SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
1. [Create and checkout a repo fork](#checkout-your-fork)

Once you have those, you can iterate on skaffold:

1. [Build your dev version of skaffold](#building-skaffold)
1. [Verify changes locally](#verifying-local-changes)
1. [Run skaffold tests](#testing-skaffold)
1. [Build docs](#building-skaffold-docs) if you are making doc changes

When you're ready, you can [create a PR](#creating-a-pr)!

You may also be interested in [contributing to the docs](#contributing-to-skaffold-docs).

## Checkout your fork

To make local changes to skaffold and eventually submit a pull request to the repo,
we recommend [creating your own fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Once you've done this, clone your fork to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/skaffold.git
   cd skaffold
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:GoogleContainerTools/skaffold.git
   git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
   ```

   _Adding the `upstream` remote sets you up nicely for regularly [syncing your
   fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)._

## IDE setup 

Skaffold uses go modules and we commit to the `vendor` directory all our dependencies to make CI faster.  
We recommend checking out Skaffold outside of the `GOPATH`. 

JetBrains Goland: 
1. `File > Open...` (choose your skaffold directory) 
2. ensure `Go > Go modules > Vendoring mode` is checked

JetBrains IntelliJ with [Go plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go): 
1. `File > Open...` (choose your skaffold directory) 
  
Visual Studio Code with [Go plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go): 
1. `File > Open...` 

## Making a config change

Some changes to the skaffold code require a change to the skaffold config. These changes require a few extra steps:

* Open the latest Config at [pkg/skaffold/schema/latest/config.go](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/blob/master/pkg/skaffold/schema/latest/config.go#L25) and inspect the comment at [L25](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/blob/master/pkg/skaffold/schema/latest/config.go#L25)
* If the line mentions the config version is not released, proceed making your changes.
  ```
  // This config version is not yet released, it is SAFE TO MODIFY the structs in this file.
  ```

* **If the line mentions** the config version is released then, 
  ```
  // !!! WARNING !!! This config version is already released, please DO NOT MODIFY the structs in this file.
  ```
  
  * Run `./hack/new_version.sh` to create a new version.

  * Run `make test` to verify changes.
  
  * Commit these generated changes, and submit a PR.

Once you've done this, merge or rebase your development branch with config changes, including the new config change.
**Any new config changes belong in pkg/skaffold/schema/latest/config.go. Do not edit the older config versions.**

* Be sure and update the documentation in `pkg/skaffold/schema/<previous_config_version>/upgrade.go` with any additions, removals, or updates you make to the config.

* In case of backwards compatibility issues, update the `Upgrade()` method from the previous config version appropriately. This is usually required when a previously existing field in the config is changed, but **not** when a new field is added.

*Note: the Upgrade() method is called by skaffold automatically for older config versions. This can also be done manually by users by running `skaffold fix`.*

* Finally, before committing your final changes and opening your pull request, be sure and run `make test` locally. This will regenerate the JSON schemas for the skaffold config with your new changes. Commit the resulting changes autogenerated by the scripts.

For more details behind the logic of config changes see [the Skaffold config management doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRIjLuHL2uZ1OXcV9ZXbOQ7ijmqmeCeOZroCGBGTgstuNaZqoKXwg0KLGt_M-PHBwoVpnsKUhHxJ3Jc/pub).

## Making changes to the Skaffold API

We build the API directly through gRPC, which gets translated into REST API through a reverse proxy gateway library. If you make changes to the [proto/skaffold.proto](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/blob/master/proto/skaffold.proto) file you can run `./hack/generate-proto.sh` to generate the equivalent Go code. 

## Building skaffold

To build with your local changes you have two options:

1. Build the skaffold binary:

   ```shell
   make
   ./out/skaffold version
   ```

   You can then run this binary directly, or copy/symlink it into your path.

1. Build and install the skaffold binary:

   ```shell
   make install
   skaffold version
   ```

   This will install skaffold via `go install` (note that if you have [manually downloaded
   and installed skaffold to `/usr/local/bin`](README.md#install), this will probably
   take precedence in your path over your `$GOPATH/bin`).

   _If you are unsure if you are running a released or locally built version of skaffold, you
   can run `skaffold version` - output which includes `dirty` indicates you have built the
   binary locally._

## Verifying local changes

If you are iterating on skaffold and want to see your changes in action, you can:

1. [Build skaffold](#building-skaffold)
2. [Use the quickstart example](examples/getting-started)

## Testing skaffold

skaffold has both [unit tests](#unit-tests) and [integration tests](#integration-tests).

### Unit Tests

The unit tests live with the code they test and can be run with:

```shell
make test
```

In case you see a linter error such as:

```shell
make test
RUN hack/linter.sh
ERRO Running error: no such linter "gocritic"
```

re-run the `hack/install_golint.sh` script to upgrade `golangci-lint`.

### Integration tests

The integration tests live in [`integration`](./integration). They can be run with:

```shell
make integration
```

_These tests require a Docker daemon, a Kubernetes cluster and all the tools
used by every Builder and Deployer, such as kubectl, bazel, java, kustomize..._

A way to run the integration tests without installing those tools
and without depending on a Kubernetes cluster is to install
[kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind#installation-and-usage)
and run:

```shell
make integration-in-kind
```

### Running a subset of integration tests

You can select specific integration tests to run via the `INTEGRATION_TEST_ARGS` env var:

```shell
INTEGRATION_TEST_ARGS="-run=TestDev/" make integration
```

### Running GCP specific integration tests

Another set of the integration tests require a GCP project because they will
push to a GCR registry or use Cloud Build to build artifacts. Those tests
can be run with:

```shell
GCP_ONLY=true make integration
```

_These tests will be kicked off by [reviewers](#reviews) for submitted PRs._

## Building skaffold docs

The latest version of the skaffold site is based on the Hugo theme of the github.com/google/docsy template.

### Testing docs locally

Before [creating a PR](#creating-a-pr) with doc changes, we recommend that you locally verify the
generated docs with:

```shell
make preview-docs
```
Once PRs with doc changes are merged, they will get automatically published to the docs
for the latest build to https://skaffold-latest.firebaseapp.com.
which at release time will be published with the latest release to https://skaffold.dev.

### Previewing the docs on the PR

Mark your PR with `docs-modifications` label. Our PR review process will answer in comments in ~5 minutes with the URL of your preview and will remove the label.

## Testing the Skaffold binary release process

Skaffold release process works with Google Cloud Build within our own project `k8s-skaffold` and the skaffold release bucket, `gs://skaffold`.

In order to be able to iterate/fix the release process you can pass in your own project and bucket as parameters to the build.

We continuously release **builds** under `gs://skaffold/builds`. This is done by triggering `cloudbuild.yaml` on every push to master.

To run a build on your own project:

```
gcloud builds submit --config deploy/cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions=_RELEASE_BUCKET=<personal-bucket>,COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --project <personalproject>
```

We **release** stable versions under `gs://skaffold/releases`. This is done by triggering `cloudbuild-release.yaml` on every new tag in our Github repo.

To test a release on your own project:

```
gcloud builds submit --config deploy/cloudbuild-release.yaml --substitutions=_RELEASE_BUCKET=<personal-bucket>,TAG_NAME=testrelease_v1234 --project <personalproject>
```

To just run a release without Google Cloud Build only using your local Docker daemon, you can run:

```
make -j release GCP_PROJECT=<personalproject> RELEASE_BUCKET=<personal-bucket>
```

## Creating a PR

When you have changes you would like to propose to skaffold, you will need to:

1. Ensure the commit message(s) describe what issue you are fixing and how you are fixing it
   (include references to [issue numbers](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
   if appropriate)
1. Add unit tests. Unit test coverage should increase or stay the same with every PR.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

Please follow our [small Pull Requests guidelines](./docs/community/small-prs.md) for quicker response time.
### Reviews

Each PR must be reviewed by a maintainer. This maintainer will add the `kokoro:run` label
to a PR to kick off [the integration tests](#integration-tests), which must pass for the PR
to be submitted.
