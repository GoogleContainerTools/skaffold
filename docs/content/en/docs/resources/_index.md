## 2019 roadmap

Note: The roadmap is subject to change and aspirational but we would like to share our plans with the user and contributor community.

* Plugin model for builders
* IDE integration - VSCode and IntelliJ Skaffold dev/build/run/deploy support, Skaffold Config code completion
* Debugging JVM applications
* Provide help with integration testing
* Skaffold keeps track of what it built, for faster restarts
* Automated kubernetes manifest generation
* Pipeline CRD integration
* Infrastructure scaffolding for CI/CD on GCP/GKE
* Document end-to-end solutions
* Status dashboard for build (test) and deployment besides logging
