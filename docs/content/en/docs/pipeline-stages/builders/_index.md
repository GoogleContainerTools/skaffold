Skaffold supports different tools for building images:

|    | Local Build | In Cluster Build | Remote on Google Cloud Build |
|----|:-----------:|:----------------:|:----------------------------:|
| **Dockerfile** | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/docker#dockerfile-locally" >}}) | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/docker#dockerfile-in-cluster-with-kaniko" >}}) | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/docker#dockerfile-remotely-with-google-cloud-build" >}}) |
| **Jib Maven and Gradle** | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/jib#jib-maven-and-gradle-locally" >}}) | - | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/jib#remotely-with-google-cloud-build" >}}) |
| **Cloud Native Buildpacks** | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/buildpacks" >}}) | - | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/buildpacks" >}}) |
| **Bazel** | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/bazel" >}}) | - | - |
| **ko** | [Yes]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/ko" >}}) | - | - |
| **Custom Script** | [Yes]({{<relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/custom#custom-build-script-locally" >}}) | [Yes]({{<relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/custom#custom-build-script-in-cluster" >}}) | - |

**Configuration**

The `build` section in the Skaffold configuration file, `skaffold.yaml`,
controls how artifacts are built. To use a specific tool for building
artifacts, add the value representing the tool and options for using that tool
to the `build` section.

For detailed per-builder [Skaffold Configuration]({{< relref "/docs/design/config.md" >}}) options,
see [skaffold.yaml References]({{< relref "/docs/references/yaml" >}}).

## Local Build
Local build execution is the default execution context.
Skaffold will use your locally-installed build tools (such as Docker, Bazel, Maven or Gradle) to execute the build.

**Configuration**

To configure the local execution explicitly, add build type `local` to the build section of `skaffold.yaml`

```yaml
build:
  local: {}
```

The following options can optionally be configured:

{{< schema root="LocalBuild" >}}

**Faster builds**

When deploying to a [local cluster]({{<relref "/docs/environment/local-cluster" >}}), 
Skaffold will default `push` to `false` to speed up builds.

Skaffold can build artifacts in parallel by setting `concurrency` to a value other than `1`, and `0` means there are no limits.
For local builds, this is however disabled by default since local builds could have side effects that are
not compatible with parallel builds. Feel free to increase the `concurrency` if you know that your builds
can run in parallel.

{{<alert title="Note">}}
When artifacts are built in parallel, the build logs are still printed in sequence to make them easier to read.

## In Cluster Build

Skaffold supports building in cluster via [Kaniko]({{< relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/docker#dockerfile-in-cluster-with-kaniko" >}}) 
or [Custom Build Script]({{<relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/custom#custom-build-script-in-cluster" >}}).

**Configuration**

To configure in-cluster Build, add build type `cluster` to the build section of `skaffold.yaml`. 

```yaml
build:
  cluster: {}
```

The following options can optionally be configured:

{{< schema root="ClusterDetails" >}}

**Faster builds**

Skaffold can build multiple artifacts in parallel, by settings a value higher than `1` to `concurrency`.
For in-cluster builds, the default is to build all the artifacts in parallel. If your cluster is too
small, you might want to reduce the `concurrency`. Setting `concurrency` to `1` will cause artifacts to be built sequentially.

When artifacts are built in parallel, the build logs are still printed in sequence to make them easier to read.

## Remotely on Google Cloud Build

Skaffold supports building remotely with Google Cloud Build.

[Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) is a
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) service that executes
your builds using Google infrastructure. To get started with Google
Build, see [Cloud Build Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-docker).

Skaffold can automatically connect to Cloud Build, and run your builds
with it. After Cloud Build finishes building your artifacts, they will
be saved to the specified remote registry, such as
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/).

Skaffold Google Cloud Build process differs from the gcloud command
`gcloud builds submit`. Skaffold will create a list of dependent files
and submit a tar file to GCB. It will then generate a single step `cloudbuild.yaml`
and will start the building process. Skaffold does not honor `.gitignore` or `.gcloudignore`
exclusions. If you need to ignore files use `.dockerignore`. Any `cloudbuild.yaml` found will not
be used in the build process.

**Configuration**

To use Cloud Build, add build type `googleCloudBuild` to the `build`
section of `skaffold.yaml`. 

```yaml
build:
  googleCloudBuild: {}
```

The following options can optionally be configured:

{{< schema root="GoogleCloudBuild" >}}

**Faster builds**

Skaffold can build multiple artifacts in parallel, by settings a value higher than `1` to `concurrency`.
For Google Cloud Build, the default is to build all the artifacts in parallel. If you hit a quota restriction,
you might want to reduce  the `concurrency`.

{{<alert title="Note">}}
When artifacts are built in parallel, the build logs are still printed in sequence to make them easier to read.

**Restrictions**

Skaffold currently supports [Docker]({{<relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/docker#dockerfile-remotely-with-google-cloud-build">}}),
[Jib]({{<relref "/docs/pipeline-stages/builders/jib#remotely-with-google-cloud-build">}})
on Google Cloud Build.
