# `ceremony`

```
ceremony --config path/to/config.yml
```

`ceremony` is a tool designed for Certificate Authority specific key and certificate ceremonies. The main design principle is that unlike most ceremony tooling there is a single user input, a configuration file, which is required to complete a root, intermediate, or key ceremony. The goal is to make ceremonies as simple as possible and allow for simple verification of a single file, instead of verification of a large number of independent commands.

`ceremony` has these modes:
* `root` - generates a signing key on HSM and creates a self-signed root certificate that uses the generated key, outputting a PEM public key, and a PEM certificate
* `intermediate` - creates a intermediate certificate and signs it using a signing key already on a HSM, outputting a PEM certificate
* `cross-csr` - creates a CSR for signing by a third party, outputting a PEM CSR.
* `cross-certificate` - issues a certificate for one root, signed by another root. This is distinct from an intermediate because there is no path length constraint and there are no EKUs.
* `ocsp-signer` - creates a delegated OCSP signing certificate and signs it using a signing key already on a HSM, outputting a PEM certificate
* `crl-signer` - creates a delegated CRL signing certificate and signs it using a signing key already on a HSM, outputting a PEM certificate
* `key` - generates a signing key on HSM, outputting a PEM public key
* `ocsp-response` - creates a OCSP response for the provided certificate and signs it using a signing key already on a HSM, outputting a base64 encoded response
* `crl` - creates a CRL from the provided profile and signs it using a signing key already on a HSM, outputting a PEM CRL

These modes are set in the `ceremony-type` field of the configuration file.

This tool always generates key pairs such that the public and private key are both stored on the device with the same label. Ceremony types that use a key on a device ask for a "signing key label". During setup this label is used to find the public key of a keypair. Once the public key is loaded, the private key is looked up by CKA\_ID.

## Configuration format

`ceremony` uses YAML for its configuration file, mainly as it allows for commenting. Each ceremony type has a different set of configuration fields.

### Root ceremony

- `ceremony-type`: string describing the ceremony type, `root`.
- `pkcs11`: object containing PKCS#11 related fields.
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `module` | Path to the PKCS#11 module to use to communicate with a HSM. |
    | `pin` | Specifies the login PIN, should only be provided if the HSM device requires one to interact with the slot. |
    | `store-key-in-slot` | Specifies which HSM object slot the generated signing key should be stored in. |
    | `store-key-with-label` | Specifies the HSM object label for the generated signing key. Both public and private key objects are stored with this label. |
- `key`: object containing key generation related fields.
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `type` | Specifies the type of key to be generated, either `rsa` or `ecdsa`. If `rsa` the generated key will have an exponent of 65537 and a modulus length specified by `rsa-mod-length`. If `ecdsa` the curve is specified by `ecdsa-curve`. |
    | `ecdsa-curve` | Specifies the ECDSA curve to use when generating key, either `P-224`, `P-256`, `P-384`, or `P-521`. |
    | `rsa-mod-length` | Specifies the length of the RSA modulus, either `2048` or `4096`.

    store-key-with-label: root signing key
key:
    type: ecdsa
    ecdsa-curve: P-384
outputs:

```

This config generates a ECDSA P-384 key in the HSM with the object label `root signing key` and uses this key to sign a self-signed certificate. The public key for the key generated is written to `/home/user/root-signing-pub.pem` and the certificate is written to `/home/user/root-cert.pem`.

The subject key used is taken from `/home/user/intermediate-signing-pub.pem` and the issuer is `/home/user/root-cert.pem`, the resulting certificate is written to `/home/user/intermediate-cert.pem`.

Note: Intermediate certificates always include the extended key usages id-kp-serverAuth as required by 7.1.2.2.g of the CABF Baseline Requirements. Since we also include id-kp-clientAuth in end-entity certificates in boulder we also include it in intermediates, if this changes we may remove this inclusion.
