# Boulder - An ACME CA

[![Build Status](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/actions/workflows/boulder-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/actions/workflows/boulder-ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is an implementation of an ACME-based CA. The [ACME
protocol](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/) allows the CA to
automatically verify that an applicant for a certificate actually controls an
identifier, and allows domain holders to issue and revoke certificates for
their domains. Boulder is the software that runs [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

## Overview

Boulder is divided into the following main components:

1. Web Front Ends (one per API version)
2. Registration Authority
3. Validation Authority
4. Certificate Authority
5. Storage Authority
6. Publisher
7. OCSP Updater
8. OCSP Responder

This component model lets us separate the function of the CA by security
context. The Web Front End, Validation Authority, OCSP Responder and
Publisher need access to the Internet, which puts them at greater risk of
compromise. The Registration Authority can live without Internet
connectivity, but still needs to talk to the Web Front End and Validation
Authority. The Certificate Authority need only receive instructions from the
Registration Authority. All components talk to the SA for storage, so most
lines indicating SA RPCs are not shown here.

                             v               |
                            CA -> Publisher  |
                             ^               |
                             |               v
       Subscriber -> WFE --> RA --> SA --> MariaDB
                             |               ^
Subscriber server <- VA <----+               |
                                             |
          Browser ------------------>  OCSP Responder

```

Internally, the logic of the system is based around five types of objects:
accounts, authorizations, challenges, orders (for ACME v2) and certificates,
mapping directly to the resources of the same name in ACME.

We run two Web Front Ends, one for each ACME API version. Only the front end
components differentiate between API version. Requests from ACME clients
result in new objects and changes to objects. The Storage Authority maintains
persistent copies of the current set of objects.

Objects are also passed from one component to another on change events. For
example, when a client provides a successful response to a validation
challenge, it results in a change to the corresponding validation object. The
Validation Authority forwards the new validation object to the Storage
Authority for storage, and to the Registration Authority for any updates to a
related Authorization object.

Boulder uses gRPC for inter-component communication. For components that you
want to be remote, it is necessary to instantiate a "client" and "server" for
that component. The client implements the component's Go interface, while the
server has the actual logic for the component. A high level overview for this
communication model can be found in the [gRPC
documentation](https://www.grpc.io/docs/).

The full details of how the various ACME operations happen in Boulder are
laid out in
[DESIGN.md](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md).

## Setting up Boulder

### Development

Boulder has a Dockerfile and uses Docker Compose to make it easy to install
and set up all its dependencies. This is how the maintainers work on Boulder,
and is our main recommended way to run it for development/experimentation. It
is not suitable for use as a production environment.

While we aim to make Boulder easy to setup ACME client developers may find
[Pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble), a miniature version of
Boulder, to be better suited for continuous integration and quick
experimentation.

We recommend setting git's [fsckObjects
setting](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/binary-transparency/f-BI4o8HZW0/discussion)
before getting a copy of Boulder to have better integrity guarantees for
updates.

Clone the boulder repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/
cd boulder
```

Additionally, make sure you have Docker Engine 1.13.0+ and Docker Compose
1.10.0+ installed. If you do not, you can follow Docker's [installation
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

We recommend having **at least 2GB of RAM** available on your Docker host. In
practice using less RAM may result in the MariaDB container failing in
non-obvious ways.

To start Boulder in a Docker container, run:

```shell
docker compose up
```

To run our standard battery of tests (lints, unit, integration):

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder ./test.sh
```

To run all unit tests:

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder ./test.sh --unit
```

To run specific unit tests (example is of the ./va directory):

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder ./test.sh --unit --filter=./va
```

To run all integration tests:

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder ./test.sh --integration
```

To run specific integration tests (example runs TestAkamaiPurgerDrainQueueFails and TestWFECORS):

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder ./test.sh --filter TestAkamaiPurgerDrainQueueFails/TestWFECORS
```

To get a list of available integration tests:

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder ./test.sh --list-integration-tests
```

The configuration in docker-compose.yml mounts your boulder checkout at
/boulder so you can edit code on your host and it will be immediately
reflected inside the Docker containers run with `docker compose`.

If you have problems with Docker, you may want to try [removing all
containers and
volumes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes).

By default, Boulder uses a fake DNS resolver that resolves all hostnames to
127.0.0.1. This is suitable for running integration tests inside the Docker
container. If you want Boulder to be able to communicate with a client
running on your host instead, you should find your host's Docker IP with:

```shell
ifconfig docker0 | grep "inet addr:" | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'
```

And edit docker-compose.yml to change the `FAKE_DNS` environment variable to
match. This will cause Boulder's stubbed-out DNS resolver (`sd-test-srv`) to
respond to all A queries with the address in `FAKE_DNS`.

Alternatively, you can override the docker-compose.yml default with an
environmental variable using -e (replace 172.17.0.1 with the host IPv4
address found in the command above)

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases -e FAKE_DNS=172.17.0.1 --service-ports boulder ./start.py
```

Running tests without the `./test.sh` wrapper:

Run all unit tests

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder go test -p 1 ./...
```

Run unit tests for a specific directory:

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder go test <DIRECTORY>
```

Run integration tests (omit `--filter <REGEX>` to run all):

```shell
docker compose run --use-aliases boulder python3 test/integration-test.py --chisel --gotest --filter <REGEX>
```

Boulder's default VA configuration (`test/config/va.json`) is configured to
connect to port 5002 to validate HTTP-01 challenges and port 5001 to validate
TLS-ALPN-01 challenges. If you want to solve challenges with a client running
on your host you should make sure it uses these ports to respond to
validation requests, or update the VA configuration's `portConfig` to use
ports 80 and 443 to match how the VA operates in production and staging
environments. If you use a host-based firewall (e.g. `ufw` or `iptables`)
make sure you allow connections from the Docker instance to your host on the
required ports.

### Working with Certbot

Check out the Certbot client from https://github.com/certbot/certbot and
follow their setup instructions. Once you've got the client set up, you'll
probably want to run it against your local Boulder. There are a number of
command line flags that are necessary to run the client against a local
Boulder, and without root access. The simplest way to run the client locally
is to use a convenient alias for certbot (`certbot_test`) with a custom
`SERVER` environment variable:

```shell
SERVER=http://localhost:4001/directory certbot_test certonly --standalone -d test.example.com
```

Your local Boulder instance uses a fake DNS resolver that returns 127.0.0.1
for any query, so you can use any value for the -d flag. To return an answer
other than `127.0.0.1` change the Boulder `FAKE_DNS` environment variable to
another IP address.

### Working with another ACME Client

Once you have followed the Boulder development environment instructions and have
started the containers you will find the ACME endpoints exposed to your host at
the following URLs:

* ACME v2, HTTP: `http://localhost:4001/directory`
* ACME v2, HTTPS: `https://localhost:4431/directory`

To access the HTTPS versions of the endpoints you will need to configure your
ACME client software to use a CA truststore that contains the
`test/wfe-tls/minica.pem` CA certificate. See
[`test/PKI.md`](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/main/test/PKI.md)
for more information.

Your local Boulder instance uses a fake DNS resolver that returns 127.0.0.1
for any query, allowing you to issue certificates for any domain as if it
resolved to your localhost. To return an answer other than `127.0.0.1` change
the Boulder `FAKE_DNS` environment variable to another IP address.

Most often you will want to configure `FAKE_DNS` to point to your host
machine where you run an ACME client. Remember to also configure the ACME
client to use ports 5002 and 5001 instead of 80 and 443 for HTTP-01 and
TLS-ALPN-01 challenge servers (or customize the Boulder VA configuration to
match your port choices).

### Production

Boulder is custom built for Let's Encrypt and is intended only to support the
Web PKI and the CA/Browser forum's baseline requirements. In our experience
often Boulder is not the right fit for organizations that are evaluating it for
production usage. In most cases a centrally managed PKI that doesn't require
domain-authorization with ACME is a better choice. For this environment we
recommend evaluating [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) or a project
other than Boulder.

We offer a brief [deployment and implementation
guide](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/wiki/Deployment-&-Implementation-Guide)
that describes some of the required work and security considerations involved in
using Boulder in a production environment. As-is the docker based Boulder
development environment is **not suitable for
production usage**. It uses private key material that is publicly available,
exposes debug ports and is brittle to component failure.

While we are supportive of other organization's deploying Boulder in
a production setting we prioritize support and development work that favors
Let's Encrypt's mission. This means we may not be able to provide timely support
or accept pull-requests that deviate significantly from our first line goals. If
you've thoroughly evaluated the alternatives and Boulder is definitely the best
fit we're happy to answer questions to the best of our ability.
