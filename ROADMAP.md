# 2022 Roadmap
Last updated: 02/15/2022

**What this roadmap is**

A list of features and concepts that we’d love to see in Skaffold over the next year. Some of these are motivated by direct community support, and some of them are things that we’re personally excited about and feel would enhance the experience of using Skaffold.

**What this roadmap is not**

A list of promises, or a hard timeline commitment. Some items on this list are still under consideration, and may be removed from the roadmap if we decide that they're not worth the engineering investment. At the time of writing this, though, we feel good about everything on this list and want to start a public conversation about it, so that we can use the community’s voice to help us drive the direction of Skaffold.

**Why we’re sharing this**

Feedback! We want to hear from each and every one of you: what are you personally excited about in Skaffold? What are the features that you most want to see? What would make your life easier? This is meant to be a public, living roadmap, where anyone can voice their opinions and we can get a true idea of where the broadest community support lies.
