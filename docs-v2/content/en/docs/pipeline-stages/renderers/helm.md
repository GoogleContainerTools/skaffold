manage Kubernetes applications. Skaffold natively supports iterative development
for projects configured to use helm.

### Helm Build Dependencies

The `skipBuildDependencies` flag toggles whether dependencies of the Helm chart are built with the `helm dep build` command. This command manipulates files inside the `charts` subfolder of the specified Helm chart.

If `skipBuildDependencies` is `false` then `skaffold dev` does **not** watch the `charts` subfolder of the Helm chart, in order to prevent a build loop - the actions of `helm dep build` always trigger another build.

If `skipBuildDependencies` is `true` then `skaffold dev` watches all files inside the Helm chart.

### `skaffold.yaml` Configuration

The `helm` type offers the following options:

Each `release` includes the following fields:

{{< schema root="HelmRelease" >}}
